HOW TO USE 

Unzip the folder into a directory of your choice and add the folder and 
all its sub-folders to the matlab path. Then execute run_example. 

This will run the guaranteed ellipse fit and the direct ellipse fit on 
synthetic data and produce a graph comparing the two methods. 

Additional examples are provided in the Inteferometer Data Examples
folder. Running the examples in that folder will also produce tables
showing the geometric parameters, the geometric covariance matrix and
the algebraic covariance matrix. 

KNOWN ISSUES
